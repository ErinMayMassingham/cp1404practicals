# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About the Project

This [project repository](https://github.com/ErinMayMassingham/cp1404practicals.git) holds my weekly programming 
practicals for the subject CP1404, ustilising task [intructions.](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals)
Each folder reflects my progress across different [Python](https://www.python.org/about/) concepts and 
[patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) including object-oriented programming, data handling, 
clean code, and file I/O. The projects are built incrementally as I apply new techniques in both logic and style 
— always improving how the code communicates as well as how it runs to achieve
[good practices](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Style-Guide#best-practice-suggestions). 

## About Me
I’m [Erin Massingham](https://github.com/ErinMayMassingham), an Engineering student at James Cook University. 
These practicals represent my evolving ability to write functional and maintainable Python code, with a strong emphasis 
on clarity, structure, and empathy — especially in collaborative and review settings.



## Clean Code Principles I’ve Learned

- **Code clarity beats cleverness**  
  If it’s readable, it’s usable. Clear logic avoids confusion, even if it's not the most condensed version.

- **One purpose per function**  
  Functions should do a single job. Breaking tasks apart makes debugging easier and improves reusability.

- **Naming matters more than comments**  
  A good variable or function name often replaces the need for a comment. The goal is self-explaining code.

- **Imperative mood is essential**  
  Whether in commit messages, function names, or docstrings — phrasing like “load_projects” or “save_file” keeps actions focused and consistent.

- **Respect the reader**  
  I format, reformat, and lint because someone else (including future me) will need to read this code and understand it quickly.
