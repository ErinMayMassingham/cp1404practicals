# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I usually estimated a shorter amount of time, I would enevitably run into a small piece of code that i would spend 
heaps of time fiddling with, but in the overall I was not taking too much longer then estimated. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

No I feel like it didnt, because as I would assume longer times the code also became more difficult and finnicky, 
so I would keep finding new things I wanted to fix and play around with. I was also not very accurate at timing myself 
as I would do a bit them stop and do some more.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt to have notes out with me to keep quicker track of the code we've worked on. Because I knew that whatever time
I would give myself to work on the code, I would get sidetracked on some of it or stuck somewhere so regardless of time,
it was quicker to set up what I needed and that helped keep my time in check.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It's just been nice to have fresh eyes to pick up on the easy mistakes that I've brushed over because I've been looking
at the code for a while and just skip over. And just to have feedback from people on the same skill level as me to see 
what they would do differently to me considereing we are both learning this at the same time. It;s made me more aware of 
what I am picking up the most in lectures and from the slides.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I like being able to see different approaches and how both can get working results, they might have shortened code 
where mine was longer. Also just reassurances that I am not the only one with imperfect work. Mainly similar to what I 
get from reading their code reviews.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review on Daniel's PR #8](https://github.com/DanielNorman47/cp1404practicals/pull/4)


### Explanation

I believe this was a good code review as I was able to spot a lot of improvement spots, most of the code was well
written which can make it harder to find where they need improvements or fixes, but I felt like I could read through and
pick up on lines they could change or unnecessary comments. You mentioned my confidence in a reply which I knew myself
was something I was struggling with and why I tried to leave lots of nice comments as well, but I felt good writing the 
fixing comments during this review. Although I could have been more professional sounding, but that will come with more 
confidence.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review on Peter's PR #7](https://github.com/Peter-Jones-G1t/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-3082177164)


### Explanation

I was unsure about my second good review, as I have a couple where I did not leave many comments at all.
I believe this was a good code review as it was later in the term I had more practice when writing it and was able to
spot more places to give feedback. I also like writing good comments when things are readable and clear and this code
was writen very well in general, in my opinion, so that makes it easy to say good things when I can't spot improvement.
This code review I felt like I was able to just write directly about changes and fixes and give out direct changes I 
might have done myself.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I don't think I would change much, there is nothing on my mind or that I have thought about these past 10-12 weeks that 
I have wanted changed. Maybe some of the photos at the beginning to be updated to showcase the newer version of pycharm
but they were not a huge issue at the time and the text instructions were always easy to follow.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Yes I am proud of how I've done, I had old past python experience that was mucking up my thought process at the
beginning but throughout the course I have gotten pretty confident in correct python procedures.
