# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

70%, I watch them in parts so I think I have watched most now with catching up, but I cannot always tell which videos I am up to.
I have been trying to write down where I'm up to but not certain.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I try to watch them in the afternoon, at the dining room table when i'm at home as my mum is napping and everyone else is out of the house.
At uni I will watch them at any time depending on what time of day I am there.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I am doing well in remembering structure, I have old, past experience in python so am working on making sure I am using the correct methods we have learnt and not old ways.
I also enjoy just using Github and pycharm.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start working earlier in the day, I have run into a few software issues where I haven't had thinsg set up correctly and it throws my schedule off loop so I need to prepare for pracs earlier.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I am working on my variables and making sure my methods are the correct way to complete the code because I know that is something i need work on.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Despite any issues in the naming and methods of code I have been able to get correct reults printing, so it's mainly clean up work from here. I think it indicates that I can understand the uses of the functions in python.
