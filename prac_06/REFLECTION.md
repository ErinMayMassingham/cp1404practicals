# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have made more effort to have proper notes with me from lectures as i write the code, i did preparing
earlier this week, but unfortatley that got derailed by a test on friday that I prioritsed studying for instead.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to be more proactive in the mornings, I usually end up ruining my sleep schedule during school term as I am more 
likely to stay up late to complete work then do it when I get up in the morning, it would be a huge stress relief
if i could wake up saturday morning and complete the work for the weekend rather then late at night

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think my understanding of the code is good, there are smaller details that I am prone to miss like some structure or
names etc, but i have a good understanding on what the actual code will do and how I can use it

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to work on my commits, I tend to just forget to commit when I stop working and just close my laptop screen 
and thankfully have not lost code yet but it effects the saves since it only have a few very small commits and one large
commit for the code

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I don't know if I missed it and there is one, but having learnjcu keep a list of github pages like the pracs, code 
review list and pages that show you how to do things like code reviews, I usually have to go back through older prac
pages to find the links, but that mayb just be my lac of direction on learnjcu
